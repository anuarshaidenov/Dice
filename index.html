      <p>
        Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or
        the player decides to "hold": If the player rolls a 1, they score
        nothing and it becomes the next player's turn. If the player rolls any
        other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn
        continues. If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to
        their score, and it becomes the next player's turn. The first player to
        score 100 or more points wins. For example, the first player, Donald,
        begins a turn with a roll of 5. Donald could hold and score 5 points,
        but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn
        total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 1, and must
        end his turn without scoring. The next player, Alexis, rolls the
        sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after which she chooses to hold, and adds her turn
        total of 22 points to her score.
